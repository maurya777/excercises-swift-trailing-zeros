[Trailing Zeros]: https://programmingpraxis.com/2020/07/07/trailing-zero-bits/

Given a positive integer, count the number of trailing zero-bits in its binary representation. For instance, 18<sub>10</sub> = 10010<sub>2</sub>, so it has 1 trailing zero-bit, and 48<sub>10</sub> = 110000<sub>2</sub>, so it has 4 trailing zero-bits.

Your task is to write a program that counts the number of trailing zero-bits in the binary representation of a positive integer. When you are finished, you are welcome to read or run a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.
